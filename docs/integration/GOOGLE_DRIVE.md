### Key Points

1. **Storage Location**: 
   All recordings will be stored under `Beesy Recordings`

2. **Auto Resume**: 
   Uploads that get interrupted will **automatically resume** once you're back online.

3. **Deletion Behaviour**: 
   Deleting a recording from the extension's recording page **does NOT delete** it from your Google Drive.

4. **Direct Download from Drive**: 
   Recordings downloaded directly from Google Drive may **lack timestamps** or have **broken seek functionality**.
   To fix this, head to the extension setting's **`Magic`** tab and use `Fix unplayable/unseekable videos`.
