# Notion: Upload Transcripts

Your transcripts are seamlessly uploaded to Notion. Here's what you need to know:

---

### ðŸ“Œ Key Points

1. **Storage Location**
   All transcripts will be saved under a parent Notion page titled **`Beesy Transcripts`**, which would look similar to the extensionâ€™s recording page.

2. **Integration Flow**
   Clicking the extension icon will start the Notion integration process:

   - **First-time users**: Select the **template provided by the developer**.

   - **Returning users**: Reuse the **same template** previously granted access.

3. **Placeholder**
   Please review the placeholder page for the Notion integration guidelines.

4. **Auto Resume**
   If the upload to Notion is interrupted, the extension will **automatically retry** until successful.

5. **Deletion Behavior**
   Deleting a transcript from the recording page **does NOT delete** it from Notion.
