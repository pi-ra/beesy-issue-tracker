### Key Points


1. **Storage Location**: 
   All transcripts will be saved under a parent Notion page titled **`Beesy Transcripts`**.
   
2. **Auto Resume**: 
   If the upload to Notion is interrupted, the extension will **automatically retry** until successful.

3. **Deletion Behavior**: 
   Deleting a transcript from the recording page **does NOT delete** it from Notion.

4. **Notion Beesy Transcripts Page**: 
   Use the transcripts as you wish, but please don't modify anything on this parent `Beesy Transcripts` page, it might break the uploads. More details [here](https://thepiraorg.notion.site/18838e779a4c806aac6eff79805433d8?v=18838e779a4c8105a1c2000cc1ecb900&p=18838e779a4c81c5bc36f90ff489fd79&pm=s)
